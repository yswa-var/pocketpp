    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Here’s a concise summary of the article in 50-100 words:

Puppeteer is a powerful JavaScript library designed for automating web browsers like Chrome and Firefox. It achieves this through a high-level API, utilizing either the DevTools Protocol or WebDriver BiDi. Notably, Puppeteer operates in headless mode by default – meaning it runs without a visible user interface, making it ideal for tasks like scraping data, testing websites, and generating screenshots. This efficient approach allows developers to control browsers programmatically for various automation needs.</p>
